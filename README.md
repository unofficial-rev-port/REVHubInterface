This is the Community Edition of REV Hub Interface.
REV Hub Interface allows you to manually control an Expansion Hub from your computer with zero code.
Originally created by REV, we have now ported it to Linux and macOS.
We have also added a more modern UI, more control features,
and overhauled the backend to make everything more responsive.

Though the original version of the software was created by REV Robotics,
this version is <ins>not maintained by or affiliated with REV Robotics</ins>.
Please do <ins>**not**</ins> contact REV Robotics official support about any issues you experience with this software;
instead, you may create a GitHub Issue or ask in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/pU2fesSTqF).

This software is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license, as is the official REV version that it is based on.

## Access to serial on Linux
To avoid needing to run REV Hub Interface with root privileges on Linux, add your user to the `dialout` group:

1. this can be done with  ```sudo usermod $USER -a -G dialout``` (on Arch Linux, you need to use `uucp` instead of `dialout`)
2. Reboot


## Connecting and Controlling an Expansion Hub
